# sc-project
Trying to make a multiplayer game to try out some code, MEAN stack, learning modules etc. etc.

Based on asteroids, star control, spacewar etc. etc.

I used Ecmascript 6 so it won't work with all  browsers yet. (I use firefox nightly beta, 
it is supposed to be released as normal firefox in a few days.)

to do:
-Client-server side communication(multiplayer)(socket.io?)
-Client lobby/ intro, ship configuration.
-Player profiles, stats and level progression written to a mongo database.
-Compatibility issues


Currently uses:
HTML/CSS/JS/Ecmascript6
Jquery/angular
Node/express/socket.io

Moin,
Rik
